# Darwinia Grant Template

## Micro Task Platform

### Project Description

We propose to develop a portal called Decentralized Micro Task Platform where different types of tasks can get done.There will be two types of main account, one is Employer & Employee OR Freelancer & Company.
Here companies do submit tasks and amount and freelancers do apply for tasks. Companies can accept or reject freelancers' applications. Once an accepted freelancer completes a task and submits his proof, the company will check and release payment.
The project will help Darwinia Ecosystem to grow as more and more users will get to know about the platform & Darwinia. It will increase the use of RING as well. There  are also no such apps built in crypto space.
We will use Darwinia to allow companies to make payments on multiple chains, we will support Polkadot native token.
